## üí° Top 3 Actionable Findings (The "Why")

The analysis isolated key customer segments driving the highest churn, enabling targeted retention strategies:

| Churn Driver | Churn Rate | Recommendation Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Early-Stage Volatility** | **29.0%** (Tenure $\le 5$ months) | Immediate Proactive Onboarding Campaigns |
| **2. Regional/Product Risk** | **42.2%** (Tier 3 customers buying Mobile Phones) | Deep-dive on regional supply chain and product quality assurance. |
| **3. Logistics Friction** | **21.0%** (Warehouse Distance $\text{26-50}$ units) | Introduce priority shipping or localized fulfillment options. |

## üèÜ Model Performance & Selection

The goal was to maximize **Recall** to ensure minimal missed churners (False Negatives). The Decision Tree model was selected for production use.

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | **Recall** | F1 Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Baseline: Logistic Regression | 90.4% | 80.8% | 54.6% | 65.2% |
| **Final: Decision Tree** | **96.98%** | **91.26%** | **90.27%** | **90.76%** |
